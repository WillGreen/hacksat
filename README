HackSat One
===========
HackSat One is a tiny satellite sprite, launching as part of the KickSat swarm. The sprite is powered by its own solar panel and is capable of broadcasting signals back to Earth. See https://flux.org.uk/projects/hacksat for details.

Development has been via Energia, a port of Arduino to MSP430: http://energia.nu.
NB. As of September 2013, the official release of Energia doesn't support the F5xxx MCU used by HackSat.

The 'payload' directory contains the sprite code.
The 'resources' directory contains mission decals.
